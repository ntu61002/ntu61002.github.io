My name is Norman Tu and I am a third-year in Shidler at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. I am currently attempting to declare my double major in Accounting and Management Information Systems. I am taking MIS becuse I've always been interested in coding and I believe that technology will become an important aspect in the future. I will enjoy learning about new techonologies throughout the semester. Overall, I will look forward to the challenges this class will bring.
