<h1> Summary </h1>
<p>After BrowserHistory 1-3, I felt more confident completeing the other WOD assignments. It made me more excited to do new WODS as they gave me a good way to determining my skill. Firstly, the BrowserHistory WODs were the simipliest to accomplism and understand. This was my first time work with CSS and it was confusing to understand but the videos helped break down teh code. Then "SmartPhoneProducts1_variables" was the first time I hadd to code with "document.write()" instad of hard coding values. This WOD took some time to figure out but I was able to complete in Rx time on my second try. Finally, "Invoice1" required me to work with variables to create a invoice receipt. I had to watch the video to understand some of the coding. </p>

For more details, here are the links to my WODs:
